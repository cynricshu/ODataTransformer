ODataTransformer
================

This project is my graduation design.
It is focus on transform OData query options ($filter, $skip, $top...) 
to hql and datasource.mongodb query sentence using Java.

I want to build a component that is easy to be embedded to any Java web applications.
This component must be light and easy to use.
With help of it, developers would be convenient at turning their application into an OData producer.

Further more, I will build a python version of it.

More information of OData will be found at
